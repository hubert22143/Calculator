# Calculator
TheOdinProject - Calculator


The project contains basic calculator, which can do basic calculations. It also display the preview of made calculation on the top of the input.

In this project I've made many unnecessary commits, which contained my not well maintained and not really good readable code which was also malsfunctioning.
At the first time,I've tried to do it basing on the objects, so I can make the code much shorter and more comfortable to read, but unfortunatly after many tries
I failed to maintain the code, which resulted me to remake it in switch - case scenario.
