# Calculator
TheOdinProject - Calculator


The project contains basic calculator, which can do basic calculations. It also display the preview of made calculation on the top of the input.

In this project I've made many unnecessary commits, which contained my not well maintained code. At the first time, I've tried to do it basing on 
the objects, so I can make the code much shorter, but unfortunatly after many tries I failed, which resulted me to make it in switch - case scenario.
